# CalyxOS

CalyxOS is an AOSP based OS, built upon many free software projects. Check out the [website](https://calyxos.org/) to learn more about the project.

## Development

The [Building CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/docs/development/build/) page on our documentation covers in detail about how you can setup the environment and build your own copy of CalyxOS for a supported device.

Contributions to the project are always welcome. Please check out the documentation on [Gerrit Code Review](https://calyxos.org/docs/development/gerrit/) which covers the general setup and workflow.
