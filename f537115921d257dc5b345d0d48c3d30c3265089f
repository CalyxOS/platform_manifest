      "message": "\u003e Those are some long repo names!\n\nTrue! We could also potentially match the naming in the `packages/modules` directories, e.g. instead of `platform_prebuilts_calyx_aml_com.android.tethering`, it could be `platform_prebuilts_calyx_aml_Connectivity`. It will have a negligible impact on whatever process we establish / scripts we use for building and placement, since we would need a mapping from module or package name to directory, but that\u0027s fine and not difficult.\n\n\u003e I don\u0027t see the need to deal with another set of prebuilts (x86_64) just yet. Double the work for not that much gain at the moment.\n\nGiven the amount of work that has already been done, this seems like a trivial amount to me. If possible, I really don\u0027t want another area for our emulator images to potentially get left behind or deviate from the on-device experience.\n\nI\u0027m not saying we need to have prebuilts for x86_64 up immediately, but I do see a need.",
